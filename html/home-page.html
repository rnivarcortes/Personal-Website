            I'm an aspiring Software Engineer that's currently a 5th-Year
            Computer Engineering student at the University of Florida. During my
            time at UF, I've honed my interest in the field to three specific
            concentrations: Frontend Development, AI & Machine Learning, and
            Project Management. I also have a fair understanding of Object
            Oriented Programming; specifically with Java, C, & C++. Overall, I
            have been introduced to most subfields within the field known as
            Software Engineer which encompases endless possibilities. This
            website is meant to share my journey as a Software Engineer.
